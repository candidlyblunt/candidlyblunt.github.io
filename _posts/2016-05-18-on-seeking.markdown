When I try to find you, <br/>
you lead me astray,  <br/>
I play your games, <br/>
hoping to lose my way.  <br/>

For I cannot seek the unknown,  <br/>
till you bring it to life. <br/>
For it does not exist,  <br/>
till I go through this strife. <br/>

So come, <br/>
play with me again,  <br/>
entertain me with your tricks, <br/>
drown me in your unknown-ness,  <br/>
immerse me in this styx. <br/>

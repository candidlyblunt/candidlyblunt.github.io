This song of silence, <br/>
which flows like a gentle stream,<br/>
yet is still like a humid summer day, <br/>
is my companion.<br/>


In the melody of its nothingness, <br/>
I listen to my inner chatter, <br/>
as it watches over me,<br/>
completing my notes,<br/>
holding my dreams, <br/>
lest they should scatter. <br/>


I look around for myself, <br/>
as this song continues to play-<br/>
ignored and forgotten.<br/>
This song of life,<br/>
the tune of the universe,<br/>
like a mirage,<br/>
which exists all the time, <br/>
yet not existing at all, <br/>
this song plays on, <br/>
yet is not heard.<br/>


This unchanging song, <br/>
this omnipresent hymn, <br/>
truly listens to me,<br/>
never judging, <br/>
expressing no doubts.<br/>
It caresses my fears,<br/>
as I slowly give-in,<br/>
and see myself in its nothingness.<br/>

I wish there was a mirror, <br/>
which told me how I felt, <br/>
which showed me my true self, <br/>
but then I am afraid, <br/>
that if I knew what I was,<br/>
would I still love myself?<br/>


Mirrors are traders,<br/>
they give you what you give them.<br/>
Neither less, nor more, <br/>
but of some things I am still unsure, <br/>
what if the mirror doesn’t reflect the truth?<br/>
What if its a shrewd trickster,<br/>
swindling around with our images? <br/>
Cause what I see in the mirror is not me, I know, <br/>
and what I really am, I still hesitate to show. <br/>


I wonder whether I will find a true mirror,<br/>
reflecting ME, <br/>
echoing MY voice. <br/>
Though harsh, <br/>
but so true.<br/>
Though aching, <br/>
yet so sweet. <br/>
Cause the mirror is reflection of pretence, not thoughts. <br/>
It is so untrue and false,<br/>
deceives me throughout my life, <br/>
gets me back to the start, <br/>
to go around again! <br/>


I blind myself to my own thirst.<br/>
I starve my soul, <br/>
Bind my flight,<br/>
Curb my voice,<br/>
Mould my image,<br/>
To fit that mirror! <br/>
Oh! That limiting mirror, <br/>
unaware of my potential, <br/>
ignorant of my choices. <br/>


If it’s just that mirror which hold me back, <br/>
I refuse to gaze in it. <br/>
I reject the need of its approval. <br/>
Cause I know that it’s too shallow to gauge my depth. <br/>
I pity those who spend their whole life framed in that mirror. <br/>
Oh! That limiting mirror...

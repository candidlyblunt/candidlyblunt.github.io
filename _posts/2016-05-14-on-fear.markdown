Remember that TV commercial,  <br />
where your dreams are shown,  <br />
trapped in a can of orange soda? 


No matter how much you have,  <br />
you are asked to "stay hungry" for more,  <br />
no life ever fulfilled,  <br />
no life ever complete.. <br />


Are you happy?  <br />
Don't look around for cues, peek inside.  <br />
Don't deny yourself the happiness of being happy,  <br />
the happiness of being YOU. <br />


Be not afraid to smile,  <br />
for happiness does not mark the death of ambition. <br />
Take time to look at how far you've come,  <br />
how you became a better version of yourself, <br />
say "thank you" to yourself (finally)!  <br />


Be happy, make happy, do happy, stay happy. <br />

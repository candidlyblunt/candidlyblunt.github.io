The last ounce of milk I had, <br/>
has turned its back on coffee today, <br/>
Not listening to my appeals, <br/>
sour, it has decided to stay. <br/>
<br/>

Starting small out of a cup, <br/>
the news has spread afar, <br/>
"could have been prevented", <br/>
reports the sugar jar. <br/>

<br/>
As this rebellion grows,<br/>
suave tea is made the makeshift boss, <br/>
jumping to the occasion, <br/>
it tells me it's "sorry" for my loss. <br/>

<br/>
Humble water is boiled and added, <br/>
no questions asked, <br/>
as I regain control of the day,<br/>
I contemplate - will this last?<br/>

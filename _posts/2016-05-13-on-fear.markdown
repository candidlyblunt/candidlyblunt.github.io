Wildfire of fear spreads, <br />
burning dreams like helpless hay,<br />
paralyzed we watch,<br />
as listless life drifts away.<br />

Dream, you do, <br />
work, you don't.<br />
Cry, you do, <br />
help you don't. <br />

The memory of failure; <br/>
The trails of tears across the cheek. <br/>
The fear of fear itself, <br/>
keeps you from what you seek! <br/>

Failing at failing, <br/>
we sleep cozy at night, <br/>
dreaming of a better tomorrow,<br/>
as today slips out of sight.<br/>

Do you really know yourself?<br />
the limitless, formless, fearless you?<br />

The one that falls, <br />
only to rise from its ashes,<br />
unbound and carefree?<br />

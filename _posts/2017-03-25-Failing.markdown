Lead me to a failure, 
a failure that rips me apart.
The brutal the end, the better,
I have to lay foundations to the next start.


The sweet blood will trickle slowly from the wounds of ignorance,
tears will wash away the toil and sweat,
As it liberates me from my own cage,
which I've built meticulously to curb my flight.

I've told myself -"I possibly can't",
I mistrusted my own guiding light,
"No more!", I thunder in the darkness,
No more will I limit my flight.

Oh this sweet failure,
this end which hails the promise of tomorrow,
It will melt this cage of comfort, complacence and inaction,
and in its flames I will glow.



the infinite promise of failure,
the ephemeral life of a success!

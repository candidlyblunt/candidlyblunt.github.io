Lead me to a failure, <br/>
a failure that rips me apart. <br/>
The brutal the end, the better, <br/>
I have to lay foundations to the next start.<br/>


The sweet blood will trickle slowly from the wounds of ignorance,<br/>
tears will wash away the toil and sweat,<br/>
As it liberates me from my own cage,<br/>
which I've built meticulously to curb my flight.<br/>

I've told myself -"I possibly can't",<br/>
I mistrusted my own guiding light,<br/>
"No more!", I thunder in the darkness,<br/>
No more will I limit my flight.<br/>

Oh this sweet failure,<br/>
this end which hails the promise of tomorrow,<br/>
It will melt this cage of comfort, complacence and inaction,<br/>
and in its flames I will glow.<br/>
Only to reveal the infinite promise of failure,<br/>
the ephemeral life of a success!<br/>

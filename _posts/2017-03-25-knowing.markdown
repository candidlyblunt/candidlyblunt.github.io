In this glorious night, 
there is nothing I cannot see, 
but for my ignorance! 

For I can only know what I know,
and can only see what I see,
while the unseen, unknown, 
feed the ignorance within me.

I follow your lead in this glorious night,
believe in you with all my might,
the dawn hits soon enough,
you, 
and the dream of you,
vanish in a puff!

For when I bind myself to what I know,
you are not within reach,
when I make knowing limitless,
you are mine to keep!

In this glorious night, <br>
there is nothing I cannot see, <br>
but for my ignorance! <br>

For I can only know what I know,<br>
and can only see what I see,<br>
while the unseen, unknown, <br>
feed the ignorance within me.<br>

I follow your lead in this glorious night,<br>
believe in you with all my might,<br>
the dawn hits soon enough,<br>
you, <br>
and the dream of you,<br>
vanish in a puff!<br>

For when I bind myself to what I know,<br>
you are not within reach,<br>
when I make knowing limitless,<br>
you are mine to keep!<br>

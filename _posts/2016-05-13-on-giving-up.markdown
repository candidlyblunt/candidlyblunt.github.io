Trembling in darkness, <br/>
you seek a ray of light. <br/>
At brink of dawn you close your eyes, <br/>
as you die out of fright. <br/>

Giving up is easy, <br/>
Giving up is fun. <br/>
Giving up seems alright, <br/>
when there are big battles to be won.<br/>

Tossing between happiness and sorrow, <br/>
you go back for more, <br/>
You work hard for what you don't need, <br/>
treating life a chore. <br/>

When the ship of life becomes a lifeboat, <br/>
you live day by day just to stay afloat <br/>
Not thinking about what you want <br/>
meaninglessness is what you flaunt. <br/>

You can change this now, <br/>
you can be everything, <br/>
there is no play of "luck",<br/>
everyone can be the king! <br/>

I seek condition-less love,
I give my hesitant trust.
I ask for limit-less freedom,
while I set unmistakable boundaries in the dust --
for you, for me, 
for that person I will never see,
for now my fear rules eve-ry-bo-dy.

My fear that my thoughts will be hijacked,
my past adjusted to fit the mould,
to unblemish my blemished self,
to rework my unworked past.
I curl-up -- retract,
letting others dictate my fate,
once without fear,
Now I let my mind vegetate.

I now feign to see light,
where I see it is dark,
I make excuses for injustice,
glorifying the suffering,
blaming the suffe-rer..
Yes, I have become this,
This, visioned-blind,
able yet dis-abled,
understanding the pain,
but ignoring the cause.

A mute bystander,
I clap when asked,
I cry on cue,
While you rip my soul,
MY-soul, into two.
Afraid of living, 
terrified of being dead,
Oh! that death which embraced me,
the day I started to fear you,
that "you" which is now me.

Yes, I can proudly say,
I am now a free puppet.

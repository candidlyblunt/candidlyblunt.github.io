I seek condition-less love,<br>
I give my hesitant trust.<br>
I ask for limit-less freedom,<br>
while I set unmistakable boundaries in the dust --<br>
for you, for me, <br>
for that person I will never see,<br>
for now my fear rules eve-ry-bo-dy.<br>

My fear that my thoughts will be hijacked,<br>
my past adjusted to fit the mould,<br>
to unblemish my blemished self,<br>
to rework my unworked past.<br>
I curl-up -- retract,<br>
letting others dictate my fate,<br>
once without fear,<br>
Now I let my mind vegetate.<br>

I now feign to see light,<br>
where I see it is dark,<br>
I make excuses for injustice,<br>
glorifying the suffering,<br>
blaming the suffe-rer..<br>
Yes, I have become this,<br>
This, visioned-blind,<br>
able yet dis-abled,<br>
understanding the pain,<br>
but ignoring the cause.<br>

A mute bystander,<br>
I clap when asked,<br>
I cry on cue,<br>
While you rip my soul,<br>
MY-soul, into two.<br>
Afraid of living, <br>
terrified of being dead,<br>
Oh! that death which embraced me,<br>
the day I started to fear you,<br>
that "you" which is now me.<br>

Yes, I can proudly say,<br>
I am now a free puppet.<br>

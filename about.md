Candidly Blunt is a blog to channelize my thoughts about topics ranging from life, politics, lifestyle, down to the mundane. This blog is an outcome of various conversations I have with my family, friends, and more importantly, with myself. 

It is not aimed to publicize any popular opinion, or to cater to anyone's likes. Often, you'll find yourself on the other side of the fence, and you are welcome to disagree. I'll just be candidly blunt.

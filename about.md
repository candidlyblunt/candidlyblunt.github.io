Candidly Blunt is a blog to channelize my opinions about topics ranging from politics, lifestyle, and the mundane. This blog is an outcome of various conversations I have with my friends, and more importantly, with myself. 

Our world view is limited to the people we interact with in our day-to-day lives. Our opinions are largely influenced by our own experiences and idiosyncrasies. This is true in my case as well. Opinions are formed by observing a small set of patterns, and cannot be viewed as generalizations. This blog is not aimed at publicizing any popular opinion, or to cater to anyone's likes. Often, you'll find yourself on the other side of the fence. You are welcome to disagree, I'll just be candidly blunt.
